# Domains and questions to think about
1. Can we replace or improve learning-from-demonstrations techniques in robotics/HRI?
2. Can we compile one language into another interactively, and allow the system to learn increasingly clean, human-readable compilations from human feedback?
  - Could it help people learn, or at least read, new languages?
3. Can we automatically convert d3.js v3 to d3.js v4?
4. Can we help people change their programs based on changes to the visualization?
5. Can we help composers generate music? (Ilya)
